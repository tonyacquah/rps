    <div> <H1>Let's play a game of ROCK PAPER SCISSORS</h1></div>
        <div><strong>How is it played?</strong>
        <p>Yow will play against me (The computer) Ha!<br>Can you win?</p>
    <p>If I chose a more powerful object, I win. If yours is more powerful, you win. Here are the rules:
        <ul>
            <li>Rock is more powerful than scissors (because it can bend and break Scissors)</li>
            <l1>Scissors is more powerful than Paper (because - know)</l1>
            <li>Paper surprisingly wins over Rock (because a paper can cover a rock)</li>
        </ul>

        So here's the summary:
        <table>
            <tr><td>Rock beats Scissors</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Scissors beats paper</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Paper beats Rock</td></tr>
        </table>

    </p></div>
